bug: parser can't handle large if-then-else statements

As pointed out by a user on Gitter, when Chapel code contains large
if-then-else statements, the parser goes off the rails.  This is true
of both the old and new parser, though the way in which they go off
the rails differs (and, I'd expect, may depend on what system you're
running on, how much memory you have, etc.)

As a workaround, a similarly large select statement can be used (when
the pattern is as regular as this, anyway).
